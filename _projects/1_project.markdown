<h4><b>Project Summary</b></h4>
In developing countries, nearly half of all deaths in children under five years old are attributed to malnutrition. There have been numerous nutritional interventions developed to prevent childhood malnutrition, although there is limited data on cost effectiveness of these programs. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of various nutritional interventions, we conducted a systematic review.We identified 3387 studies by searching the Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Clinical trials.gov. Out of those studies,13 studies met inclusion criteria (in Dec 2016). 11 out of 13 studies included revealed that the nutritional intervention implemented was more cost effective as compared to usual care or placebo in different areas. When subgroup analysis was performed among the nutritional intervention types, community based interventions showed high cost effectiveness, followed by increase in cost effectiveness in dietary interventions with one dietary intervention in Mali showing a better outcome but a costlier approach. This review suggests that nutritional interventions are cost effective as compared to usual care or placebo of under-five children in developing countries

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
* Nearly half of all deaths in children under five years old are attributed to malnutrition.
* Nutritional deficiencies in children are costly for the economy of a country causing potential loss of income or impaired socioeconomic advancement.
* A systematic review of studies evaluatingthe cost benefit of interventions to preventmalnutrition in developing countries may help to identify effective interventions and whether differences exist between countries.

<h4><b>Objective</b></h4>
Among children 0-5 years of age in underdeveloped and underprivileged countries, we want to know if nutritional interventions lead to improved measures of cost compared to usual care.

<h4><b>Methods</b></h4>
**Study Eligibility:**
Clinical trials, cohort, and cost-effective analysis study designs were included that compared placebo or usual care with intervention (education, dietary, community based, cash based transfers, and integrated health facility care).

**Search Methods:**
We searched Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google scholar, EMBASE and clinical trial registries thru November 2016 using keywords and MeSH terms to generate the following themes of childhood nutrition, developing countries and cost.

**Study identification and selection**

<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
* Many studies suggest nutritional interventions are cost effective.
* Further research using standardized outcome measures is needed to determine cost effectiveness of different nutritional interventions based on country.
