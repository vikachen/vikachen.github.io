<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
* Alcohol use disorders affect over 17 million adults in the United States as of 2012.
* Only a third of the population seeks treatment and less than ten percent receives medication for alcohol abuse.
* The purpose of this decision analysis is to determine which drug out of naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate and topiramate is most effective at increasing the number of non-drinking days among those who have received a score of 15 or higher on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tool (AUDIT) screening.

<h4><b>Objective</b></h4>
* Use decision tree Markov modeling to determine which pharmacological intervention for alcohol abuse has the highest payoff in number of sober months per 12-month period.
* Primary care providers can then utilize this tool to decide which pharmacologic therapy should be prescribed.

<h4><b>Methods</b></h4>
* Markov Model: Relapse common and recurring
* Primary Outcome: Months of Sobriety 
* 12 Month Timeframe* Incremental Rewards: Four 3-Month Payoff Cycles; Abstinence (3 months); Partial Abstinence (1.5 months); Any Drinking (0 months); Death (0 months)<h4><b>Results</b></h4>
Topiramate is preferred arm with 7.62 months of abstinence:

<h4><b>Discussion</b></h4>
* Topiramate has the highest efficacy of any drug available and a moderate discontinuation rate, making it the preferred drug.
* While less effective, acamprosate and naltrexone have much lower discontinuation rates.
* Acamprosate becomes the preferred drug if topiramate’s discontinuation rate goes above ~0.30 for its current rate of drinking.
* If topiramate’s discontinuation rate goes above ~0.65 even disulfiram will become favored over topiramate but not acamprosate.

<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
* Heavy drinkers wishing to abstain from drinking should begin treatment with topiramate.
* Topiramate is found to be most effective as it has the lowest rate of returning to drinking in combination with a moderate drop out rate.
