    <h4><b>Team Member</b></h4>
<p>Samuel T. Kunkel, Michael L. Ormont, <strong><em>Shuang Chen</em></strong>, Clifford Reilly Jr.</p>

<h4><b>Project Summary</b></h4>
<p>The historic and most widely accepted clinical use of opioids, particularly LAOs, has been in patients with cancer. More recently there has been a trend toward increased utilization of LAOs in non-malignant chronic pain. However, use of LAOs for acute pain, such as in the post-operative setting, remains controversy, and there remains a relative paucity of evidence to either support or refute their utilization in this situation.</p>

<p>We conducted a literature research in Medline for original articles and reviews pertaining to the opioids, with a focus on their mechanism of action, side effect profiles, and distinguishing features between long and short acting formulations. Specific attention was paid to their use in total joint arthroplasty post-operative protocols, and all identified articles relevant to this topic were reviewed.</p>

<p>While more research needs to be done to further clarify this issue, current evidence does not support the routine use of LAOs in total joint arthroplasty patients for the management of acute post-surgical pain. We recommend that LAOs be used very selectively in post arthroplasty patients, and preferably avoided. Given the equivocal nature of the evidence for their use and strong evidence for risk we believe that LAO therapy should be replaced by SAO. Multimodal pain management for arthroplasty patients are needed, including patient education, administration of preemptive analgesics, epidural analgesia, peripheral nerve blocks, periarticular nerve block, periarticular injections in addition to postoperative oral analgesics.</p>

<h4><b>Objective</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Evaluate the use of long-acting opioids (LAOs) in the post-operative total joint arthroplasty population, with regard to effectiveness and risks.</li>
  <li>Provide recommendations regarding the use of long-acting opioids in this population.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Methods</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Medical literature contained within the Medline database was searched for original articles and reviews pertaining to long acting opioids.</li>
  <li>Particular focus  was placed on their mechanism of action, side effect profiles, and distinguishing features between long and short acting formulations.</li>
  <li>Specific attention was paid to their use in total joint arthroplasty post-operative protocols</li>
  <li>All identified articles relevant to this topic were reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>About 300,000 total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 700,000 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) operations are performed annually in the US, and this is expected to increase substantially over the coming decades.</li>
  <li>Adequacy of pain management in this population affects recovery of functional mobility and patient satisfaction.</li>
  <li>Post-operative pain management protocols often involve narcotic analgesia.</li>
  <li>Controlled release, long-acting opioid formulations (LAOs) have the theoretical benefit of stable serum concentrations, however use of LAOs  may have distinct risks including abuse and diversion potential.  The risk is higher in patients who are using narcotics preoperatively, the number of whom are increasing.</li>
  <li>It is important to evaluate this critical issue and provide recommendations regarding the use of LAOs in post-operative total joint arthroplasty patients.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/project_2_img_2.png" width="700" /></p>

<h4><b>Potential Actions</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Continued utilization of LAOs in post-operative pain protocols, with close monitoring and enhanced patient education regarding the risks of these medications.</li>
  <li>Elimination of LAOs from total joint arthroplasty post-operative analgesic protocols.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Recommended Actions</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Evidence does not support the routine use of LAOs in total joint arthroplasty patients for the management of acute post-surgical pain.</li>
  <li>LAOs should be used very selectively in post arthroplasty patients, and preferably avoided.</li>
  <li>We recommend pursuing multimodal pain management for arthroplasty patients, including a combination of some or all of the following strategies: (1) Patient education (2) Administration of pre-emptive analgesics (3) Epidural analgesia (4) Peripheral nerve blocks (5) Periarticular nerve blocks (6) Periarticular injections (7) Oral analgesics</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Evaluation Plan</b></h4>

<ul>
  <li>Implementation of this recommendation could be evaluated through patient centered subjective pain metrics and objective clinical assessment (including measures of overall opioid consumption).</li>
  <li>On a community and population level its impact might be assessed through evaluation of addiction, illicit narcotic diversion, and accidental overdose.</li>
</ul>
