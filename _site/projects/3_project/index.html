<h4><b>Project Summary</b></h4>
<p>Alcohol use disorders affect over 17 million adults in the United States as of 2012. Only a third of the population seeks treatment and less than ten percent receives medication for alcohol abuse. The purpose of this project is to determine which pharmacological intervention for alcohol abuse is most effective at increasing the number of non-drinking days among alcohol abuse population.</p>

<p>Meta analyses and randomized controlled trials were used to obtain data on the probability of discontinuing the drug due to adverse effects and the probability of abstaining from alcohol vs. continued drinking. Mortality rates due to alcohol-related causes were obtained from a CDC lifetable database.  We use TreeAge software to create a Markov model that included five decision tree arms – Topiramate, Acamprosate, Disulfram, Naltrexone and a no treatment arm. Probabilities were converted to a three-month timeframe. Incremental payoffs were assigned to each Markov cycle of 3 months of sobriety.</p>

<p>Topiramate is most effective by increasing 7.62 months of non-drinking days. (Acamprosate: 7.17 months; Disulfram:5.65 months, Naltrexone: 4.63 months, No-treatment: 3.97 months) The result of 1-way sensitive analysis shows that when the probability of discontinuation of Topiramate is lower than 0.30, Topiramate is better option. When the probability of discontinuation of Topiramate is larger than 0.30, Acamprosate is preferred.</p>

<p>We recommend Topiramate could be considered for FDA approval to treat alcohol abuse based on our study.</p>

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Alcohol use disorders affect over 17 million adults in the United States as of 2012.</li>
  <li>Only a third of the population seeks treatment and less than ten percent receives medication for alcohol abuse.</li>
  <li>The purpose of this decision analysis is to determine which drug out of naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate and topiramate is most effective at increasing the number of non-drinking days among those who have received a score of 15 or higher on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tool (AUDIT) screening.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Objective</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use decision tree Markov modeling to determine which pharmacological intervention for alcohol abuse has the highest payoff in number of sober months per 12-month period.</li>
  <li>Primary care providers can then utilize this tool to decide which pharmacologic therapy should be prescribed.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Methods</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Markov Model: Relapse common and recurring</li>
  <li>Primary Outcome: Months of Sobriety</li>
  <li>12 Month Timeframe</li>
  <li>Incremental Rewards: Four 3-Month Payoff Cycles; Abstinence (3 months); Partial Abstinence (1.5 months); Any Drinking (0 months); Death (0 months)</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Results</b></h4>
<p>Topiramate is preferred arm with 7.62 months of abstinence:</p>

<p><strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>

<p><img align="middle" src="/assets/img/project_3_img_3.jpg" width="600" height="480" /></p>

<h4><b>Discussion</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Topiramate has the highest efficacy of any drug available and a moderate discontinuation rate, making it the preferred drug.</li>
  <li>While less effective, acamprosate and naltrexone have much lower discontinuation rates.</li>
  <li>Acamprosate becomes the preferred drug if topiramate’s discontinuation rate goes above ~0.30 for its current rate of drinking.</li>
  <li>If topiramate’s discontinuation rate goes above ~0.65 even disulfiram will become favored over topiramate but not acamprosate.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Heavy drinkers wishing to abstain from drinking should begin treatment with topiramate.</li>
  <li>Topiramate is found to be most effective as it has the lowest rate of returning to drinking in combination with a moderate drop out rate.</li>
</ul>
