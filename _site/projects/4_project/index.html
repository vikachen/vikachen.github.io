  <article class="post-content Capstone &#58; The Need for Expedited Approval -- Policy Recommendation for Oncology and Orphan Drugs in China clearfix">
    <h4><b>Project Summary</b></h4>

<p>Patients with cancer or rare diseases in China struggle with no effective drug therapy. Even though some oncology or orphan drugs are in the market for several years in the US, Chinese patients have no access to them due to the delays involved in having new drugs approved for use in the US, but not approved for use in China. The FDA in the United States has experience in dealing with this challenge - how to balance the safety and efficacy in the approval process especially for patients with serious and life-threatening diseases. Should CFDA using FDA expedited programs as a model to solve the problem of delay in drug approval?</p>

<p>To answer this question, I conduct a policy systematic review to analyze how expedited approvals apply on oncology and orphan drugs in the US. In accordance with China’s pharmaceutical market environment, I proposed recommendations that include developing a dialogue mechanism between sponsors and CFDA. Further study is needed to focus on reimbursement of oncology drugs and orphan drugs to realize its affordability to patients. </p>

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>China had 4.3 million new cancer cases in 2015. Cancer is a leading cause of death, it is
responsible for 28% of deaths in China.</li>
  <li>There are more than 10 million patients with rare diseases in China (underestimation).</li>
  <li>Of the 291 drugs approved in the United States, 27% were approved in China. Even though some drugs have been in the market for several years in the US, Europe and other developing countries, Chinese patients have no access to it due to the “drug backlog”. Some patients have no choice and turn to unofficial channels and purchase drugs in the gray market.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Policy Question</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>How to respond to the urgent demand of patients with a life-threatening disease?</li>
  <li>How to solve the problem of “drug backlog”?</li>
  <li>Should CFDA introduce regulations to speed up the approval of oncology and orphan drugs?</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Conceptual Model</b></h4>
<p><img align="middle" src="/assets/img/project_4_img_2.png" width="700" heigth="600" /></p>

<h4><b>Criteria</b></h4>
<p><b>Inclusion Criteria</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mainly discussed about mechanism or characteristics of expedited approval programs (including Fast Track, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy).</li>
  <li>The type of article could be primary studies, opinion, commentary, review, report or official documents, etc.</li>
  <li>The approved drug discussed in articles should be oncology drugs or orphan drugs, or drugs treating rare disease.</li>
  <li>The approval process should be in Food and Drug Agency in United State.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Exclusion Criteria</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Studies mainly talked about approval process in EU, Japan, or any other countries.</li>
  <li>The approved drug is treating HIV or other diseases even they are under the expedited approval programs.</li>
  <li>It is an official FDA drug approval summary for one specific drug. (Even it contains original and reliable data for the drug, which might be utilized in the future).</li>
  <li>It is a short announcement to announce one specific drug gain approval or enter the market.</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Parallel Searching</b></h4>
<p><img align="middle" src="/assets/img/project_4_img_3.png" width="700" heigth="600" /></p>

<h4><b>Recommendation</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>CFDA should introduce regulations to expedite access of oncology and orphan drugs immediately.</li>
  <li>CFDA should build a rationale to give guidance for drug sponsors.</li>
  <li>Develop a dialogue mechanism between sponsors and agency.</li>
  <li>Post-approval confirmatory studies need to be conducted carefully.</li>
</ul>
