    <h4><b>Project Summary</b></h4>

<p>Patients with cancer or rare diseases in China struggle with no effective drug therapy. Even though some oncology or orphan drugs are in the market for several years in the US, Chinese patients have no access to them due to the delays involved in having new drugs approved for use in the US, but not approved for use in China. The FDA in the United States has experience in dealing with this challenge - how to balance the safety and efficacy in the approval process especially for patients with serious and life-threatening diseases. Should CFDA using FDA expedited programs as a model to solve the problem of delay in drug approval?</p>

<p>To answer this question, I conduct a policy systematic review to analyze how expedited approvals apply on oncology and orphan drugs in the US. In accordance with China’s pharmaceutical market environment, I proposed recommendations that include developing a dialogue mechanism between sponsors and CFDA. Further study is needed to focus on reimbursement of oncology drugs and orphan drugs to realize its affordability to patients. </p>
